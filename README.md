# Python-Campground-Booking-Program

This is a very simple, limited, and poorly coded campground booking program. It is capable of adding and removing bookings to a file, and stores each new booking sale in a separate file.

To run this program, you will need:
 - Python 3

Use this program or code however you want, it was just something that I wanted to get out of my head. Use it commercially if you want as well, I doubt that you will be able to though.
